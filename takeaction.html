<h1>Let's Take Action!
	<p>Global Warming has affected us for far too many years and will continue if nothing is done. Fortunately, there are small and large foundations and websites that allow anyone to make a change, 
	no matter how small or large. There are also other options if you don't want to donate. You've probably heard the famous phrase, "Reduce, reuse, recycle," too many times. Too many times, people
	underestimate the importance of this process. There are many options to take to help the environment, making the right choice is a step to preserving our world for better things.
